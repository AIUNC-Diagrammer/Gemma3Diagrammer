The gemma\_train notebook is designed to fine tune a gemma3 1b model on a dataset.json in the same directory, when run.



Server.py should be run to initialize a local server, serving as the back end for a small web app to test the fine tuned model and the back end for a small api for the model.



Access the web app at localhost:5000 



To start the server a valid MODEL\_PATH should be specified



To run the model fine tuning script a Hugging Face token is required
